## Project Summary:
For this project, our goal is to simulate what it would be like to be standing on a given celestial body in virtual reality. This program is going to be serviceable to both the general public as well as the NASA scientists currently working for the Psyche asteroid mission. Regarding the public, this project is meant to serve as an experience to excite them about space travel and spark their curiosity. It has the possibility of being shown off at public events where members of the general public will be able to wear a VR headset and both see and move around the celestial world we created for them. However, for the scientists, we are expected to format our project in such a way that the experience could be ported over to new Psyche data once the probe reaches the asteroid and gives us accurate information. In the meantime, while we wait for the Psyche mission to finish, scientists can also evaluate our simulation and even perform tests with it if they choose to do so. When it comes to development tools, we have elected as a team to develop our program in the Unity game engine as some members already have experience with the engine and it has the tools and resources to help us create an amazing product. This project will be connected to and monitored by the sponsors through their own private Github repository. Regarding celestial body choice, we have elected to first undergo more research on NASA’s data repositories to explore the format, quality, and quantity of their stored data and then choose based on those parameters. We aim to have a complete core functional experience within 6 months and a polished product shortly after. We hope to create a product that both satisfies the public’s interest as well as our sponsors expectations.

#### Answers from first meeting with Sponsor:
Q: What else besides visual appearance?  
A: Up to you, keep the scope in mind, don’t bite off more than you can chew. Pop-ups etc could be good add-ons, but keep the core project (just appearance) as the focus. Try to get something working by spring break and use the rest of the time for testing and debugging.

Q: What environment/language/toolkit?  
A: Meta Quest /VRD MakerSpace. NASA 3d web based. Mars track, vesta track. Look at documentation for that stuff. Figure out what seems cool to work in and what dataset might be cool to work with. Osiris Rex?

Q: What is the targeted user base?  
A: Those interested in science among the general public, could be found in museums, etc.

Q: How will the project be delivered?  
A: Long term is to make it available to those who have their own headsets so some kind of public way to send it out.

Q: What outcomes are expected?  
A: Does it work? Reliable, well documented. It would be cool to be able to pull real data, maybe a stretch? Track what we learn, what we research, what we do. Will be wrapped into some of the sprint reports and presentations, and stuff like that.

## Getting Started:
There's a lot that goes into this project, and as documentation was one of the bigger requests by the sponsor, we will try to keep accurate track of the steps we took to get to our awesome final project. Hopefully by following these steps, you can duplicate our results.
